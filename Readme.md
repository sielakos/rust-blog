# Sielakos blog code

This is simply source code of my blog.
Nothing fancy here just compiling markdown files to generate static blog page.

To run locally use

```bash
cargo run
```

It will start local instance of blog on port 8080.
It has file watchers for assets and inputs directory so it will rebuild each time any file is changed.
